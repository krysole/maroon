TASKLIST

- Implement va parameter primitive functions.
- Design and implement for loop/enumeration.
- Implement interval support for enumeration, but not interval objects yet.

- Implement code generation, without real garbage collection for now, for
	methods.
- Implement fluorite_class_data generation for classes.
- Update method code generation to at least ensure that the managed references
	are stored in the stack frame separately from other stack frame data, and that
	they are at the beginning of the frame, along with a 32 bit count field and 
	managed frame link field as an offset rather than a pointer.

- Continue analyzing the design and tasks for The Fluorite Programming Language.
